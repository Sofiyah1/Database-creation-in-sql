# Database-creation-in-sql
Infospace_Dao is a diversed Web3 community of NFT and CRYPTO Enthusiasts
A database was created and two tables where included;
The Moderator and Members Info ,
Some queries were executed such as filtering only the female Members,getting members who prefer Twitter as a social platform and have earnings above $500.
I also did segregation based on Age group and arrived at the fact that the community is 90% populated by GenZ(s).
